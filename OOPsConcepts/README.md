1. Encapsulation
    1. Hides data using getters and setter.
2. Abstraction
   1. Hides implementation details using interface and abstract class.
3. Inheritance:
   1. the Is-a relationship
   2. Types of inheritance:
      1. Single Inheritance: Vehicle <--- FuelVehicle
      2. Multiple: Fuel Car <--- Hybrid Car, Electric Car <--- Hybric car
      3. MultiLevel: Vehicle <--- Fuel Car <---- Hybrid car
      4. Hierarchical: Vehicle <---- Fuel Car, electric car
      5. Hybrid: combination of Multiple and Multilevel
4. Polymorphism
   1. Dynamic Polymorphism:
      1. Method Overriding:
   2. Static Polymorphism:
      1. Method Overloading:
      2. Operator Overloading: not supported in java and js
